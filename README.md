# ML_test
This is my ML test with jupyter notebook

But I think pycharm is more friendly for beginners like me! (yes a lot of syntex errors ðŸ™„

But Jupyter is super useful when you wanna change a line and the command "%matplotlib inline" is really helpful =)

Maybe I can just type all my codes in Pycharm and then test it in Jupyter (hahaha
